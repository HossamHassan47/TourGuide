    <string name="home_fragment_details_1">Cairo is chaos at its most magnificent, infuriating and beautiful. \n\nFrom above, the distorted roar of the muezzins\' call to prayer echoes out from duelling minarets. \n\nBelow, car horns bellow tuneless symphonies amid avenues of faded 19th-century grandeur while donkey carts rattle down dusty lanes lined with colossal Fatimid and Mamluk monuments.</string>
    <string name="home_fragment_details_2">This mega-city\'s constant buzz and noise is a product of its 22-or-so million inhabitants simultaneously crushing Cairo\'s infrastructure under their collective weight and lifting its spirits up with their exceptional humour. \n\nYour nerves will jangle, your snot will run black from the smog and touts will hound you at every turn, but it\'s a small price to pay to tap into the energy of the place Egyptians call Umm Ad Dunya â€“ the Mother of the World.</string>
    <string name="home_fragment_details_3">Blow your nose, crack a joke and look through the dirt to see the city\'s true colours. \n\nIf you love Cairo, it will definitely love you back.</string>
